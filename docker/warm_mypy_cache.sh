# Warms mypy's cache, which the image did not ship. Most of what mypy does on a
# kata is not looking at the kata: it analyses typeshed's stubs for the standard
# library, and that work is identical on every test-run and has nothing to do
# with what a learner wrote. A kata runs in a container thrown away afterwards,
# so without a cache that analysis was repeated every time.
#
# The cache is world-writable because a kata runs as the sandbox user and mypy
# adds to the cache as the learner's own files change. The container is thrown
# away afterwards, so nothing outlives the run.

# A cache is keyed on the mypy version and the flags that filled it. If those
# ever drift from what cyber-dojo.sh runs, mypy silently reanalyses and the
# test-run is merely as slow as it was before. This compares a run against the
# warmed cache with one against an empty one, and insists the warm run be
# clearly quicker. A cache that is not being hit scores about 1.
#
# The comparison is against a cold run rather than a fixed number of seconds
# because this same script runs under QEMU when the arm64 half of the image is
# built on an amd64 machine. Emulated, a warm run takes far longer than it does
# natively, so any threshold that fits one fails the other. A ratio holds either
# way: both runs are slowed by the same emulation. It does shrink under
# emulation, because mypy's startup costs the same whatever the cache holds and
# emulation inflates it, so the bar is set well below what a native run scores.
#
# The source is edited first, so the warm run is measured the way a kata meets
# it, with the learner's file changed and only the stubs still cached.
